 * CS4050 - Assignment 3
 * Determine the approximate integral of a function on an interval 2 ways using probabilities:
 * 1) Dart throwing
 *      construct a rectangular region around function, pick random points in rectangle,
 *      find percentage of these that are in the area under the function
 * 2) Mean of values at random locations
 *      compute mean value of function at random locations in interval and multiply this value
 *      by the interval's width
 *
 * And then compare these two methods to the trapezoid method (accuracy and running times)
